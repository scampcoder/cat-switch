# Cat Switching App

I recently tried my first obligatory light switcher app with JS and just didn't like it so much. So, I tried the same procedure in a different way to learn how to do this better, with something a bit more fun.

All in all, it's a very simple app, but it taught me more about this type of JS function (mostly CSS) and I feel more confident trying my hand at things like this.
